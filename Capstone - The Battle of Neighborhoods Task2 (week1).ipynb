    "[1] Düsseldorf is a city on the River Rhine in western Germany and is the capital city of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is one of the economic centers of the country, and a major city within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, with a population of almost 600,000.The capital of North Rhine-Westphalia Germany, Dusseldorf is a regional economic powerhouse straddling the banks of the Rhine River. Altstadt is Dusseldorf's lovely old town.\n",
    "#### 1.1 Discussion and background\n",
    "[2] Düsseldorf is connected to some national and international cycling paths, including EV15 The Rhine Cycle Route. The city of Düsseldorf is a member of the German North Rhine-Westphalia District, Municipality and City Friends of Pedestrians and Cyclists Working Group, who bestowed upon Düsseldorf the title of \"Friend of Cyclists City\" in 2007, although the city still has a few gaps in the network of cycle paths in the eyes of many of its citizens.\n",
    "####  1.2 Problem to be resolved\n",
    "City have some official bicycle parking spots but most all of them are located on railway station. Can we endorse a location in Duesseldorf to open a new bicycle parking?. New bicycle parking spot will motivate people to go shopping or hangout on bicycles which can reduce the traffic and car parking problem in the city.\n",
    "#### 1.3 Targeted audience\n",
    " The report is aimed primarily at those involved in city planning, sports clubs and students learning data science."

    "We are going to predict a new bicycle parking location, so a list of existing bicycle location will a perfect point to start. We will need a list of coordinates where currently existing parking are located. For the sake of simplicity we will ignore the number of parking spaces assigned to each bicycle parking place. Also we will only consider bicycle parking which are official assigned from the city. A list of all the zip codes in the city which will be use to gather and cluster the bicycle frendly businesses from each neighbourhood.\n",
    "The other list we need is the number and type of businesses and avenue located around these existing parking places. Average distance of bicycle parking from avenues can be calculated later. \n",

    "#### 2.2 Data sources\n",
    "A variety of publicly open data about the city of Duesseldorf is available on the city website. We will be using https://opendata.duesseldorf.de/node/40945/download, where a list of all bicycle parking locations with latitudes and longitudes are available as csv file. This data is maintained by the city itself "
